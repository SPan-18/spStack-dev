## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added missing \value{} tag to sim_spData.Rd and simGLMexact.Rd.

* Add example to get_stacking_weights.Rd.

* Removed commented out lines in examples.

* Removed \dontrun{} from all examples.

* Changed \dontrun{} to \donttest{} for examples that will take longer to run.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note
