Description: Fits Bayesian hierarchical spatial process models for
    point-referenced Gaussian, Poisson, binomial, and binary data using stacking
    of predictive densities. It involves sampling from analytically available
    posterior distributions conditional upon some candidate values of the
    spatial process parameters and, subsequently assimilate inference from these
    individual posterior distributions using Bayesian predictive stacking. Our
    algorithm is highly parallelised and hence, much faster than traditional
    Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms while delivering competitive predictive
    performance. See Zhang, Tang, and Banerjee (2024)
